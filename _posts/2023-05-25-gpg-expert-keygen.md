title: "GPG Expert Keygen: Keys auf die richtige Weise generieren"
---

GPG Keys sind der wahrhaftige "Schlüssel" zur Identität. Mit ihnen können Commits auf GitHub unterschrieben, Emails und Dateien verschlüsselt werden, oder Zugänge zu Servern oder Diensten abgesichert werden. Die Erstellung eines primären Hauptschlüssels und mehrere Unterschlüsseln wird als best-practice betrachtet. Auf diese Weise können die Subkeys auf weiteren Systemen genutzt werden, ohne die Sicherheit des Hauptschlüssels zu kompromitieren. 

Außer dem Hauptschlüssel sollten also folgende Schlüssel generiert werden:

- (S) ECDSA Curve 25519 Sign, zum Unterschreiben von Commits und Emails.
- (E) RSA 4096 Encrypt, um Dateien und Emals zu verschlüsseln. 
- (A) ECDSA Curve 25519 Authenticate, zur Authentifizierung gegen Dienste.

Warum RSA 4096 um Dateien und Emails zu verschlüsseln? RSA ist weiter verbreitet also die neueren (und sicherern) Schlüssel die auf Ellyptic Curve Cryptography basieren. Um zu gewährleisten dass Empfänger und Sender auch miteinander kommunizieren können, ist diese Herangehensweise ein aufgrund der immer noch sehr hohen Sicherheit von 4096 bit ein meiner Meinung nach akzeptabler Kompromis.

GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.

Real name: John Doe
Email address: john@doe.com
Comment: Example
You selected this USER-ID:
    "John Doe (Example) <john@doe.com>"

Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? O
We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

Create a revocation certificate for this key? (y/N) y
Please select the reason for the revocation:
  0 = No reason specified
  1 = Key has been compromised
  2 = Key is superseded
  3 = Key is no longer used
  Q = Cancel
(Probably you want to select 1 here)
Your decision? 0
Enter an optional description; end it with an empty line:
> 
Reason for revocation: No reason specified
(No description given)
Is this okay? (y/N) y
ASCII armored output forced.
Revocation certificate created.

Please move it to a medium which you can hide away; if Mallory gets
access to this certificate he can use it to make your key unusable.
It is smart to print this certificate and store it away, just in case
your media become unreadable.  But have some caution:  The print system of
your machine might store the data and make it available to others!
